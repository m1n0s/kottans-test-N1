# Hello [Kottan](http://kottans.org/) or anybody else!

## Intro

There is test task for JS course by [Kottans](http://kottans.org/).

You can see requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15UzM6jsXQ8sAB8IQCvKZnDVXukcAL878Q36VqcITi3Y/edit).

My goal at this task was that if it is JS course - then I must show how my js-ninja-sword is powerful and elegant. So I decide to use only plain JavaScript with only one external lib - [handlebarsjs](http://handlebarsjs.com).
Also I used Twitter Bootstrap Grid for responsive.
And this app work perfect in up to date Google Chrome, so I didn't use any polifylls or js translators and other same things.

## Getting Started

To run this app:
* Go to [m1n0s.github.io](http://m1n0s.github.io/) or open index.html in Google Chrome
* Enjoy my work

## Features

* At start you choose ammount of pokemons by 1 request
* Click on card and you will see details about current pokemon
* There are up to 2 types at each pokemon. Clicking on them will start filtering.
* When filter types more then one - it will show switch toggle to choose filter rule. `all` is equivalent `AND` and `any` => `OR`.
* If you already enable filtering and decide to load more: filters will disable, and can't enable while new data isn't received. (That's feature, not bug)

## TODO
#### What I can do now, but don't have time.

- [ ] All DOM variables pack into one object
- [ ] Mix visible poke cards
- [ ] Go to top button
- [ ] Animate filterings (not sure)
- [ ] Visualise data on detail card (use progress bars or etc)
- [ ] Always visible filters
