# Hello [Kottan](http://kottans.org/) or anybody else!

## Intro

There is a test task for JS course by [Kottans](http://kottans.org/).

You can see requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15UzM6jsXQ8sAB8IQCvKZnDVXukcAL878Q36VqcITi3Y/edit).

As it is JS course, my goal at this task is to represent how my js-skill-sword is powerful and elegant. So I decided to use only plain JavaScript with only one external lib - [handlebarsjs](http://handlebarsjs.com).
Also I used Twitter Bootstrap Grid for responsive.
This app works perfect in up to date Google Chrome, so I didn't use any polifylls, js translators and other same things.

## Getting Started

To run this app:
* Go to [m1n0s.github.io](http://m1n0s.github.io/) or open `index.html` in Google Chrome
* Enjoy my work

## Features

* At start you should choose amount of pokemons by 1 request
* Click on any card and you will see details about current pokemon
* There are up to 2 types at each pokemon. Clicking on them will start filtering.
* When filter types are more than one - a switch toggle will be shown to choose filter rule. `all` is equivalent `AND` and `any` => `OR`.
* If filtering is already enabled and you decide to load more, filters will be disabled, and can't be enable while new data isn't received. (That's a feature, not bug)

## TODO
#### What I can do more, but don't have enough time.

- [ ] Pack all DOM variables into one object
- [ ] Mix visible pokemon cards
- [ ] Add `Go to top` button
- [ ] Animate filtering (not sure)
- [ ] Visualise data on detail card (use progress bars or etc)
- [ ] Make filters always visible
